# 🚀 GPU Training FAQ - Your Questions Answered

## ❓ **"Can I still see training logs with GPU training?"**

### ✅ **YES! You get FULL real-time training logs:**

1. **Live Progress Bar** - Shows 0% → 100% completion
2. **Current Stage** - "Preprocessing" → "Training" → "Saving Models"
3. **Epoch Progress** - "Epoch 1/50, 2/50, 3/50..." in real-time
4. **Loss & Accuracy** - Live updates: "Loss: 0.8234, Accuracy: 85.2%"
5. **Time Estimates** - "~15 minutes remaining"
6. **Training Logs Panel** - Detailed text logs streaming live

### 📊 **How It Works:**
- GPU instance sends progress updates to your main server
- Your frontend receives real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE
- You see the same interface as CPU training, just faster!

## ❓ **"How much will it cost?"**

### 💰 **Very Affordable:**

| Training Session | Time | Cost |
|------------------|------|------|
| **CPU Training** | 2-4 hours | $0 (but slow) |
| **GPU Training** | 15-30 min | $0.13-0.26 |

### 📊 **Cost Breakdown:**
- **g4dn.xlarge**: $0.526/hour × 0.25-0.5 hours = **$0.13-0.26**
- **g4dn.2xlarge**: $0.752/hour × 0.17-0.33 hours = **$0.13-0.25**

### 💡 **Cost Tips:**
- **Set up billing alerts** (free)
- **Use smaller datasets** for testing
- **Instances auto-terminate** after training
- **Only pay when training** (not idle time)

## ❓ **"What's the difference between CPU and GPU training?"**

### 🖥️ **CPU Training:**
- Uses your local computer
- 2-4 hours per training session
- Free (but slow)
- Limited by your hardware

### 🚀 **GPU Training:**
- Uses AWS professional GPUs
- 15-30 minutes per training session
- $0.13-0.26 per session
- 10-50x faster
- Same training logs and interface

### 🎯 **Same Experience, Different Speed:**
- Same frontend interface
- Same training logs
- Same model quality
- Just much faster!

---

## ❓ **"What if something goes wrong?"**

### 🛠️ **Easy Troubleshooting:**

1. **Run the verification script:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_aws_setup.py
   ```
   - Tells you exactly what's wrong
   - Gives you the fix

2. **Common fixes:**
   - Wrong credentials → Run `aws configure`
   - Missing resources → Follow setup guide
   - Wrong IDs → Check your `.env` file

3. **Fallback:**
   - If GPU fails, it falls back to CPU training
   - Your training never gets stuck

### 📞 **Support:**
- Clear error messages
- Step-by-step fixes
- Fallback to CPU if needed
